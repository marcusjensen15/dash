## Note on this branch:

App is now properly scaling across all devices. See branch: mobile-views2+modualize. Below are some notes:

TL/DR - Everything looks good across all devices on Firefox & Chrome. Safari has some issues (See below)

-App looks good across all devices on both chrome and Firefox. On Safari, I ran into two problems:

1. Theorem logo is not showing up in Safari for some reason.
2. Chart JS for whatever reason does not work in Safari.

I didn't spend a ton of time troubleshooting these issues. Perhaps Safari is not comparable with SCSS, or there are some additional NPM packages that need to be installed in order to get Chart JS to work on Safari.

-I took things a step further and removed all of the inline styles the previous interns left. There is still plenty of room for cleanup as the previous classes were not defined using scss best practice. The good thing is all CSS is now living in a stylesheet and not inline.

This task is 99% done, just having those issues with Safari. I'm not familiar with working on browsers outside of Chrome.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
